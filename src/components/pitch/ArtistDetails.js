        If the project is interesting to you we would start out negotiating one-off freelance pieces and see how things go. If we work well together then we can re-evaluate and discuss something more serious. The work I’m looking to be done starts at designing the characters and backgrounds up to the line work for those characters and backgrounds (backgrounds which will be reused). I have someone that can do coloring already (I can share artist’s work for reference). I am willing to work with what you’re comfortable with, so if just line work is more interesting to you, we can talk about that. If just designing characters is interesting, or just sketching before line work, these are all things I am willing to work with.

        <strong>Goal art style description:</strong> In my willingness to be open to new perspectives and ideas, I am flexible on the art style. However, the general style I intend to aim for is somewhere between the very cartoon-ey style of Scott Pilgrim and the sharpness of your typical anime/manga style. I am not quite looking for the level of detail typically seen in many Marvel/DC type american comics because I intend to create a faster workflow as well as leaving the characters cartoon-ey enough so the reader can put at least some of their imagination into how the characters look
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>An important detail that makes the art workflow simpler:</strong> The comic panels are mostly single frame rectangular pieces (so the panels won’t be cut up in all sorts of crazy mini-shapes like you find in a lot in the more traditional physical comics). The text will largely be underneath the panels, so no need to worry about incorporating the text into the panel, no letterwork, no speech bubbles.

        <br/>
        <strong>Some ways I can work with you:</strong>
        <br/>
        – I can draw well enough to get an idea across. So if words fail to convey something, I can sketch up something simple for reference, especially if it makes the workflow easier.
        <br/>
        – I am open and flexible to collaboration. At the same time, I understand if it is easier to simply get the final word on something. I understand everyone exists on a different point in this range. If something is too weird or difficult to do, feel free to state this. The story and getting it out there is more important than a slightly different angle on the panel perspective or how exact a character looks to how I imagined.

        <strong>What I have so far:</strong>
        <br/>
        – The title/logo
        <br/>
        – Visual mockups and descriptions of main characters
        <br/>
        – Ending / overarching story path already planned
        <br/>
        – 70+ pages of raw script (which translates into even more panels)
        <br/>
        – 20+ panels (script broken into panels and decisions made about
          <br/>
        – Domain for website (I am a web engineer, so I will be taking care of the website without much trouble)
