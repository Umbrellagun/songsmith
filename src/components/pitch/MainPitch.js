        <strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        High school seniors Evelyn, Clint, and Jack have a new problem with being attacked by monsters made out of sound. In case you were wondering, this is not normally an issue high schoolers have. Thankfully, around the same time they start periodically being attacked, a mysterious figure gifts instruments to them that, when played, summon creatures that can protect them. These instruments also have other unique abilities, like opening portals to other worlds.  At the center of this chaos is a figure out to control the multiverse and a group called The Circle of Fifths that seeks to destroy both The Sound Monstersâ„¢ as well as our heroes. This sets the three on a journey to find out who these people are and why they are being attacked.

        The mood of this story is Scott Pilgrim battling monsters; a music focused fantasy with music theory incorporated into the story via personification of music theory concepts and use of music theory terminology. The main characters summon their monsters by playing very specific sets of notes (think: the ocarina from Ocarina of Time meets Pokemon) which are then used to map out actual musical compositions that can be discovered and listened to on the web alongside the comic. To top it off, the story is stylized with a choose your own adventure flare.
