      <p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>The setting is a gothic church. In the center of the image, set in the background, is a large chair with a couple of steps leading up to it. A figure in a modern day black suit and tie (alternatively in a white suit and tie) very casually sits in this chair. In one hand he is so delicately holding an oboe that it makes it look like the instrument will slip and fall to the floor at any moment. A mask covers his face. The front of the mask appears to have no openings for eyes to see through or a mouth opening to speak through, but has a soundwave pattern painted or etched over the smooth surface (I can provide an image for the soundwave symbol). It’s aesthetic looks as if someone made a Daft Punk mask, but hundreds of years ago. So instead of the futuristic space feel, it has a confused aesthetic, a modern concept with a pre-industrial revolution execution (Possibly with an ivory base and silver filigree). Behind this character, you can see six silhouettes. These silhouettes are difficult to distinguish details of other than possibly that they are also all in suit and tie attire. You might also be able to make out a harp, violin, and trumpet in some of their hands / near them (optional organ to the right of these characters, left for the viewer). Above and behind these characters are stained glass windows. The most prominent window is a large circular shape that has layered rings. The outer ring is like a clock-face with roman numerals. A middle and smaller ring lines up with each hour of the clock shape, but instead mirrors the circle of fifths and it’s notes.  In front of all of this, on the right side of the foreground, are the three main characters jumping / charging with their instruments, a guitar, bass, and keytar, brandished like weapons. Opposite them, on the left side of the foreground, are demon-like stray notes that are jump-attacking, their mass looking as if it were forming a wave about to crash down on the heroes.</p>
